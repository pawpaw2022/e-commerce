Project idea #1: Online shopping API
I would like to create an API that facilitates online shopping by providing essential features to support both buyers and sellers. The API will include methods to:
- Return a list of available products by category, brand, or price range, pulling data from a product database.
- Take in a product ID and return detailed information about the product, including specifications, images, and customer reviews.
- Allow users to search for products by name or keyword, and sort the results by relevance, price, or popularity.
- Take in a user ID and return their shopping cart contents, including the total price and any applicable discounts.
- Integrate with a payment gateway API (such as Stripe or PayPal) to process payments securely.
- Allow for the addition, update, and removal of products by sellers, including setting prices, managing stock levels, and uploading product images.
- Generate order details, allowing users to track the status of their orders through shipping information updates.
I will first focus on building the core methods, then integrate them into an API using FastAPI or Flask, allowing external clients to interact with the shopping system through HTTP requests.
